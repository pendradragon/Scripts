It's not scripts, rather, the code that I've written for webservers for this lab. 

Lab Summary:
  In this lab, you will use Windows 10 as the mail server, and Rocky Linux for a web server. The lab has three parts. The forst part will have you configure an Apache web server. Once the server is running, you will create virtual hosts ad produce a self-signed certificate to encrypt HTTP communications. Part 2 will explore the protocols and roles of various devices involved in email communication. The final part will give you experience running cron jobs and centralized logging in your enviroment.
