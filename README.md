# Scripts

Scripts written for NSSA 221. Each of the scripts have been published after their due date. 

This repo acts as a portfolio of class work to show employers. All scripts are written in Python3 and tested on Rocky Linux.


ping_test.py (Script01)
  Purpose: This script, designed for end-users, facilitates network connectivity testing. Its purpose is to simplify troubleshooting by enabling the user to execute the script and report the results to the system administrator. Specifically, the script, run from a Rocky 8 virtual machine, checks connectivity to the gateway, a remote IP address, and a URL, ensuring DNS resolution functions correctly. The output is designed to be clear and straightforward, ensuring that the end-user provides accurate and unambiguous information to the system administrator.

  system_report.py (Script02)
    Purpose: To create a script that automates the process of manually running commands that gathers system information from each host. 

  shortcut.py (Script 03)
    Purpose: Finding and creating symbolic links, including identifying their target paths, using both Bash and Python commands within the script.

  attacker_report.py (Script 04)
     Purpose: This report will analyze the system log file, highlighting IP addresses with ten or more failed login attempts. It should include the number of these attempts, their countries of origin, and the report's date. This script will help identify potentially compromised servers across the organization.
